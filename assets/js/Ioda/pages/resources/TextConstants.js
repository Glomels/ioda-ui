    title: "Outage Detection",
    content: (
      <>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For each data source (BGP, Active Probing, and Telescope), we
            currently monitor for three types of outages: country-level,
            region-level and AS-level.
          </li>
          <li>
            Detection is performed by comparing the <em>current</em> value for
            each datasource/aggregation (e.g., the number of /24 networks
            visible on <em>BGP</em> and geolocated to <em>Italy</em>) to an{" "}
            <em>historical</em> value that is computed by finding the{" "}
            <em>median</em> of a sliding window of recent values (the length of
            the window varies between data sources and is listed below).
          </li>
          <li>
            If the <em>current</em> value is lower than a given fraction of the
            <em>history</em> value, an alert is generated. Each data source is
            configured with two <em>history-fraction</em> thresholds; one that
            triggers a <em>warning</em> alert, and one that triggers a{" "}
            <em>critical</em> alert. The warning and critical thresholds for
            each data source are listed below. These values are experimental and
            are based on empirical observations of the signal to noise ratio for
            each data source.

        <h4>Outage Severity Scores</h4>

        <h5>Alert Area</h5>
        <p>
          To quantify the <strong>severity</strong> of an outage, we use a
          concept we call <em>Alert Area</em>, which takes into account both the
          magnitude of the outage and the duration of the outage. The alert area
          is computed by multiplying the relative drop (i.e.,{" "}
          <code>((history - current) / history) * 100</code>) by the length of
          the outage (in minutes). All alert tables in IODA show Alert Area
          values as per-datasource outage severity scores.
        </p>

        <h5>Overall Score</h5>
        <p>
          While we perform outage detection on a per-datasource basis, we use
          multiple datasources to gain confidence about an outage. To do this,
          we compute an <em>Overall Score</em> by <em>multiplying</em> the{" "}
          <em>Alert Area</em> scores for each data source that triggered an
          alert. We multiply Alert Area scores together (rather than summing
          them) to give weight to outages that have been detected through
          multiple datasources.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Caveat:</strong> While the "Overall Score" values given in the
          alert tables reflect a multiplication of the total alert area for each
          data source, the "Overall Score" value shown in the "Outage Severity
          Levels" visualizations is instead the sum of the overall score values
          for each minute in the time window. That is, an overall score is
          computed for each minute by multiplying together the alert areas for
          that minute, and then these per-minute overall scores are summed to
          give the total shown when hovering over a country or region.
